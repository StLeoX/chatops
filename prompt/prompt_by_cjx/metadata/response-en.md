# Server fault Injection test detailed report

## Overview

This report is based on a series of fault injection tests performed on servers. In these tests, we simulated multiple failure scenarios to assess how the server performed under different stress and failure conditions. Failure types include network delay, resource competition, service interruption, etc., to fully understand the performance of the server under various extreme conditions. This test involved several drills, including 'user-netdelay', 'frontend-netdelay', and 'catalogue-netdelay'. The analysis focuses on key metrics such as CPU usage, number of packets (received and sent), and bandwidth usage (received and sent). We will conduct a detailed analysis of the data from each walkthrough to reveal correlations between individual metrics and identify abnormal patterns.

## Data trend analysis

### 1. 'user-netdelay' drill analysis

- **CPU usage**: The CPU usage peaked at 26% at Unix time 1699255094, significantly higher than the normal range of 2%-10%.
- **Number of packets**: The number of packets received and sent surged to 73,853 at 1699255094, indicating a significant increase in network activity.
- **Bandwidth usage**: The receive bandwidth surged to 12,732,043 at the same time, further confirming the increase in network traffic.

### 2. 'frontend-netdelay' drill analysis

- **CPU usage**: The peak CPU usage reached 64% at 1699255234, far beyond the normal fluctuation range.
- **Number of packets**: The number of packets received and sent reached a significant high at this time, with the number of packets received reaching 142,233 at 1699255234.
- **Bandwidth usage**: The receiving bandwidth reached 48,201,360 at the same time, indicating a huge amount of network traffic.

### 3. 'catalogue-netdelay' drill analysis

- **CPU usage**: The highest CPU usage peak is 17% at 1699255234, outside the normal fluctuation range.
- **Number of packets**: The number of packets received surged to 53,716 at 1699255234, indicating a significant increase in network interaction.
- **Bandwidth usage**: The receive bandwidth surged to 7,472,066 at the same time, further proving the increase in network traffic caused by fault injection.

## Correlation analysis between key indicators

In all walkthroughs, significant spikes in CPU usage often coincide with increases in packet volume and bandwidth usage, indicating that the CPU resource requirements of the server increase significantly in the case of high network traffic and fault injection.

## Abnormal pattern recognition

In each walkthrough, there are some unusual patterns that may indicate potential problems with the system in a specific failure scenario:

1. **Short Time spikes**: Short time spikes in CPU usage, packet volume, and bandwidth usage were observed in all walkthroughs.
2. **High load for a long time**: The system remains in a high load state for a long time after some faults are injected, indicating a slow response capability or insufficient resource release mechanism.
3. **Uneven resource usage**: The fluctuation mode of resource usage in each drill is inconsistent, indicating that the server has different resource allocation and load processing capabilities under different types of fault injection.

## Summary and suggestions

Based on the above analysis, the following conclusions and suggestions can be made:

1. **Performance bottleneck**: The system displays performance bottlenecks under extreme conditions, especially in terms of CPU and network bandwidth. Resource scaling and optimization are recommended to cope with high load situations.
2. **Optimization of resource management**: It is recommended to optimize the resource management and load balancing mechanism to deal with emergencies and high load situations more effectively.
3. **Fault recovery capability**: Improving the fault recovery mechanism and shortening the recovery time is recommended to improve the system's elasticity.
4. **Continuous monitoring and early warning mechanism**: Strengthening real-time monitoring of key indicators and establishing an effective early warning mechanism is recommended.
5. **Further testing and analysis**: Continuing similar fault injection tests to collect more data to deeply understand the impact of different fault types on system performance is recommended.
