# Server fault Injection test detailed report

## Overview

This report is based on a series of fault injection tests performed on servers. In these tests, we simulated multiple failure scenarios to assess how the server performed under different stress and failure conditions. Failure types include network delay, resource competition, service interruption, etc., to fully understand the performance of the server under various extreme conditions. This test involved several drills, including 'user-netdelay', 'Frontender-netdelay', and 'catalogue-netdelay'. The analysis focuses on key metrics such as CPU usage, number of packets (received and sent), and bandwidth usage (received and sent). We will conduct a detailed analysis of the data from each walkthrough to reveal correlations between individual metrics and identify abnormal patterns.

## Data trend analysis

### 1\. 'user-netdelay' drill analysis

- **CPU usage ** : In user-netdelay, CPU usage peaked at 26%, much higher than the normal range of 2%-10%. In particular, at the Unix time point 1699255094, we observed a significant spike in CPU usage.
- ** Number of packets ** : Corresponding to the peak of CPU usage, the number of packets received and sent at this time also shows a significant increase. For example, the number of packets received surged from the normal value to 73,853 at 169,9255,094.
- ** Bandwidth usage ** : Bandwidth usage also fluctuated significantly at the same time. The receive bandwidth increased from the usual tens of thousands to 12,732,043, further confirming the surge in network activity during peak CPU usage.

### 2\. 'frontend-netdelay' drill analysis

- **CPU usage ** : In this exercise, the peak CPU usage reached 64% (1699255234 Unix time point), which is far beyond the normal fluctuation range.
- ** Packet volume ** : At the same time that CPU usage peaked, the number of packets received and sent also reached a significant high. For example, the number of packets received reached a staggering 142,233 at 169,9255,234, showing an increase in sync with CPU usage.
- ** Bandwidth usage ** : Matching the increase in the number of packets, bandwidth usage also reached a peak at this moment, with the receiving bandwidth reaching 48201360, indicating a huge amount of network traffic.

### 3\. 'catalogue-netdelay' drill analysis

- **CPU usage ** : In the catalogue-netdelay, the highest CPU usage peak is 17%, which occurs at the Unix time point 1699255234. This peak is also outside the normal fluctuation range, suggesting a high demand for resources in a particular fault injection scenario.
- ** Number of packets ** : Corresponding to the peak CPU usage, at 1699255234 time, the number of packets received rose from the usual hundreds to 53716, indicating that network interaction increased significantly at this time.
- ** Bandwidth usage ** : Coinciding with the peak in CPU and packet numbers, bandwidth usage also saw a significant increase at the same time. For example, the receive bandwidth surged to 7,472,066 at this moment, further proving the increase in network traffic caused by fault injection.

## Correlation analysis between key indicators

In the three fault injection drills above, we observed a clear correlation between several key metrics:

In all walkthroughs, significant spikes in CPU usage often coincide with increases in packet volume and bandwidth usage. This phenomenon indicates that the CPU resource requirements of the server increase significantly in the case of high network traffic and fault injection.

The surge in the number of packets is usually accompanied by a corresponding increase in bandwidth usage, which indicates that the peak of network traffic is not just an increase in the number of packets, but an increase in the overall data transmission, which puts higher demands on the network interface and processing power of the server.

- In 'frontend-netdelay' and 'catalogue-netdelay', we note in particular that CPU usage increases as packet numbers and bandwidth usage rise, indicating that the CPU takes on a heavier task in handling the increased network load.


## Abnormal pattern recognition

In each walkthrough, there are some unusual patterns that may indicate potential problems with the system in a specific failure scenario:

1. ** Short Time spikes ** : In all of our walkthroughs, we observed short time spikes in CPU usage, packet volume, and bandwidth usage. This may indicate the system's emergency response under a sudden increase in load.

2. ** High load for a long time ** : In some cases, the system remains in a high load state for a long time after fault injection, which may indicate a slow response capability or insufficient resource release mechanism when the system returns to a normal state.

3. ** Uneven resource usage ** : The fluctuation mode of resource usage in each drill is inconsistent, which may indicate that the server has different resource allocation and load processing capabilities under different types of fault injection, indicating that resource management and load balancing policies need to be optimized.

## Summary and suggestions

Based on the above analysis, we can draw the following conclusions and suggestions:

1. ** Performance bottleneck ** : Under extreme conditions, the system displays performance bottlenecks of resources such as CPU and network bandwidth. Resource scaling and optimization is recommended, especially in terms of network bandwidth and processing power, to cope with high load situations.

2. ** Optimization of resource management ** : Considering the uneven use of resources, it is recommended to optimize the resource management and load balancing mechanism to deal with emergencies and high load situations more effectively.

3. ** Fault recovery capability ** : Considering that the system maintains a high load for a long time after some faults are injected, it is recommended to improve the fault recovery mechanism, shorten the recovery time, and improve the elasticity of the system.

4. ** Continuous monitoring and early warning mechanism ** : It is recommended to strengthen the real-time monitoring of key indicators and establish an effective early warning mechanism to respond in time when similar failure situations occur.

5. ** Further testing and analysis ** : It is recommended to continue similar fault injection tests to collect more data to deeply understand the impact of different fault types on system performance in order to develop more targeted optimization measures.


These measures can improve the stability and performance of the server in the face of various faults, and ensure the reliable operation of the system under various extreme conditions.
